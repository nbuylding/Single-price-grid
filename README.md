## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to center a container using the positions relative and absolute instead of flexbox.


### Continued development

One thing I need to work on is finding an easier and more effective way to make a website responsive. 

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped to remind me how to use certain CSS tools, specifically the shorthands for padding and margins.
- [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped to remind me of the value placement for the margin and padding shorthands.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me to center a container without using flexbox by default.
